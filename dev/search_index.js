To circumvent this issue, moment bounding schemes seek to identify a proxy for mathbfy_q(t), say tildemathbfy_q(t), which minimizes (or maximizes if upper bound is sought) a certain statistic of the process under investigation, while ensuring that tildemathbfy_q(t) remains in certain ways consistent with the process under investigation (we will see shortly what that means concretely).

To that end, MarkovBounds.jl automatically translates high-level problem data framing a jump-diffusion process as specified via convenient tools such as Catalyst.jl, Symbolics.jl/ModelingToolkit.jl or DynamicPolynomials.jl into sum-of-squares (SOS) programs and solve them via the existing optimization pipeline in Julia (see SumOfSquares.jl, JuMP and MathOptInterface.jl).

However, even though this approach works remarkably well over a wide range of applications and powerful software tools supporting this approach exist (see e.g. DifferentialEquations.jl), it may break down in certain settings. Most notably, the generation of sample paths can become prohibitively expensive when the process under investigation is highly stiff and/or volatile, rendering simulation expensive and/or convergence of sample statistics to the true statistics slow. In those cases, practitioners tend to fall back on approximation techniques such as tau-leaping, moment closure approximations and many more, which recover tractability at the cost of introducing unverifiable assumptions and an unknown error. Moment bounding schemes can be used to quantify/bound this error by providing hard bounds on key statistics, both in the transient and stationary setting.
